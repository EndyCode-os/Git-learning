Here’s a full summary of Git and GitHub, how they work together, the most used Git command lines, and some useful file/folder commands you can do via the command line.

**What is Git?**
-Git is a distributed version control system.

-It tracks changes in your source code during software development.

-It allows multiple developers to work on the same project without overwriting each other’s changes.

-Every developer has a local repository (copy of the entire project history).

-You can commit changes locally, and later push those commits to a remote repository.


**What is GitHub?**
-GitHub is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories.

-It provides a remote repository for sharing code with others.

-It adds collaboration features like pull requests, issue tracking, code review, CI/CD integration, and project management tools.

-Essentially, GitHub is where you push your local Git commits to collaborate and back up code online.


**How Git and GitHub work together?**
-You create a Git repo on your local machine.

-You connect it to a remote repo hosted on GitHub.

-You commit changes locally using Git commands.

-Then you push commits to GitHub to share them.

-Others can clone your GitHub repo, make changes, then push their changes back.

-You can manage contributions, review code, and merge changes using GitHub’s web interface.
